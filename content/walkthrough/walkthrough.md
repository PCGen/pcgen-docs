General Note
------------

If at any time a frame in PCGen does not appear or is too small, you can
resize it by dragging the divider bar to the left/right, or up/down, as
applicable.

This walkthrough will step you through the process of creating a
character and printing a character sheet. It's recommended that you view
the [Start Up](/walkthrough/initial-startup.html) section first.

This process is divided into the following steps:

1.  [Initial Startup](/walkthrough/initial-startup.html)
2.  [Campaign Source Loading](/walkthrough/load-campaign.html)
3.  [Toolbar Quick Icons](/walkthrough/toolbar-quick-icons.html)
4.  [Creating a new character](/walkthrough/create-character.html)
5.  [Printing the finished character](/walkthrough/print-new.html)

Additional detail is provided in the [Players
Section](/tab/summary.html) of this guide found under the [Tabs and
Buttons](/tab/tab.html) section.
