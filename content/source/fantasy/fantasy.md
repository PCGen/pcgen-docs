The 3e and 35e gameModes represent the third edition and the 3.5 edition
of the fantasy role playing game published by Wizards of the Coast. Our
datasets are based on the version of this game published under the Open
Gaming License commonly known as the [Standard Reference Document or
SRD](/source/fantasy/srd.html) . The rules were recently revised and
that version is known as the [(Revised) Standard reference Document or
RSRD](/source/fantasy/rsrd.html) . All of the datasets which appear in
the sources tab along with the SRD and RSRD are dependent on having
these loaded and will not function properly without them.
