The **Sources** menu is used to select, load, reload, and unload data
sets within PCGen for the use of the user. The menu options are as
follows:

The **Select Sources** command will call up the [**Select
Sources**](/menu/sources/selection.html) window where you can select and
load data sets from the large collection of data sets distributed by
PCGen.

Options](../../images/menus/sources/menu_sources_02_loadsources.png)

The **Load Sources** command presents a list of standard pre-configured
sets. These sets consist of the following:\

-   MSRD
-   Pathfinder RPG for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
-   Pathfinder RPG for Players
-   Pathfinder for Players - Advanced
-   SRD 3.0 for Players
-   SRD 3.5 for Game Masters (includes Monsters)
-   SRD 3.5 for Players

You can add your own custom configurations to this list through the
[Select Sources](/menu/sources/selection.html#savecustom) window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Reload Sources** command will reload the current sources.

The **Unload Sources** comman unloads the current sources.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [**Install Data**](/menu/sources/install-data.html) command allows
the installation of data sets completed and distributed by the PCGen
team as Out-of-Cycle (OOC) data sets. This is also particularly useful
for GMs who have created their own campaign files as it simplifies the
process of sharing the sets with their players.
