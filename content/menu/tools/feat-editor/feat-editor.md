The Feat Editor is to create you own Feats, edit ones you have already
made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Feats (from
other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Feat.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Feat (Feats
created within this Feat Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected FeatÂ  (Feats created
within this Feat Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Feat. In this way you can
slightly modify an existing Feat and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Feats added will be saved into the customFeats.lst file.
