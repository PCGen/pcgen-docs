The Language Editor is to create you own Languages, edit ones you have
already made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing
Languages (from other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Language.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Language
(Languages created within this Language Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected Language  (Languages
created within this Language Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Language. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Language and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Languages added will be saved into the customLanguages.lst file.
