The Race Editor is to create you own Races, edit ones you have already
made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Races (from
other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Race.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Race (Races
created within this Race Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected RaceÂ  (Races created
within this Race Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Race. In this way you can
slightly modify an existing Race and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Races added will be saved into the customRaces.lst file.
