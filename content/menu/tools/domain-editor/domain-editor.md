The Domain Editor is to create you own Domains, edit ones you have
already made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Domains
(from other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Domain.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Domain (Domains
created within this Domain Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected DomainÂ  (Domains created
within this Domain Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Domain. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Domain and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Domains added will be saved into the customDomains.lst file.
