The Skill Editor is to create you own Skills, edit ones you have already
made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Skills (from
other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Skill.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Skill (Skills
created within this Skill Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected SkillÂ  (Skills created
within this Skill Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Skill. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Skill and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Skills added will be saved into the customSkills.lst file.
