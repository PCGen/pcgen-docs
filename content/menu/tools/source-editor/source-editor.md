The Source Editor is to create you own Sources, edit ones you have
already made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Sources
(from other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Source.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Source (Sources
created within this Source Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected SourceÂ  (Sources created
within this Source Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Source. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Source and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Sources added will be saved into the customSources.lst file.
