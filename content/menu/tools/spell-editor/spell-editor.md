The Spell Editor is to create you own Spells, edit ones you have already
made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Spells (from
other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Spell.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Spell (Spells
created within this Spell Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected SpellÂ  (Spells created
within this Spell Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Spell. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Spell and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Spells added will be saved into the customSpells.lst file.
