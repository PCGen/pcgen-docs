The Template Editor is to create you own Templates, edit ones you have
already made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing
Templates (from other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Template.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Template
(Templates created within this Template Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected TemplateÂ  (Templates
created within this Template Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Template. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Template and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Templates added will be saved into the customTemplates.lst file.
