The Deity Editor is to create you own Deities, edit ones you have
already made, and in the future will allow you to edit existing Deities
(from other data/list files).

The **New** button will allow the creation of a new Deity.

The **Edit** button will allow you to edit the selected Deity (Deities
created within this Deity Editor only at this stage).

The **Delete** button will remove the selected DeityÂ  (Deities created
within this Deity Editor only at this stage).

The **Copy** button makes a copy of a selected Deity. In this way you
can slightly modify an existing Deity and give it a new name.

The **Close** button will allow you to exit back to PCGen.

Deities added will be saved into the customDeities.lst file.
