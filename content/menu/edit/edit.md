These are the **Edit** menu options that are available to use to modify
characters within PCGen. These options are used for starting a new PC,
loading an existing PC, or exporting a currently loaded PC to a file.

The [**Add Kit**](/menu/edit/addkit.html) command allows the selection
and application of Starting Kits to the current character or may be used
to create Default Monsters.

The <span id="eqset"></span> **Equipment Set** command has not yet been
enabled. When it is enabled it will allow the selection of an equipment
set from those previously created on the **Inventory/Equipment** tab and
will make it the active equipment set.

The <span id="tempbonus"></span> **Temporary Bonus** command has not yet
been enabled. When it is it will allow the activation or deactivation of
temporary bonuses that have been applied to the active character, or the
character's equipment, on the **Temporary Bonuses** tab.
