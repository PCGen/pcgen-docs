The **Settings** option is used to customize PCGen for the use of the
user.

The [**Game Mode/Campaign**](/menu/settings/gamemode.html) menu is used

modes).

The [**Preferences**](/menu/settings/preferences.html) menu is used to
set configurations of PCGen itself. This includes character generation
options and more.

The [**Load Source**](/menu/settings/source-loading.html) option is used
to select and load the gameMode and data sets to be used. This includes
the ability to create and configure new **Load Sets** .
