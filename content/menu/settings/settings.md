The **Settings** option is used to customize PCGen for the use of the
user.

The [**Game Mode/Campaign**](/menu/settings/gamemode.html) menu is used
to select what game mode you wish to create your character in. The game
mode displayed is determined by what is in the campaign pcc file in the
data sets (The menu will expand to the right displaying all current game
modes).

The [**Preferences**](/menu/settings/preferences.html) menu is used to
set configurations of PCGen itself. This includes character generation
options and more.

The [**Load Source**](/menu/settings/source-loading.html) option is used
to select and load the gameMode and data sets to be used. This includes
the ability to create and configure new **Load Sets** .
