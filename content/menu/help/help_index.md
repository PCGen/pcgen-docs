The **Help** menu lists the available documentation. The available
options are:

-   The **Documentation** option brings up the full html documentation
    (you are looking at it now!).
-   The **Display OGL License** will display the full Open
    Gaming License.
-   The **Display Sponsors** will display a PCGen's sponsors.
-   The **Tip of the Day** will display a pop up window with the Tip of
    the Day!
-   The [**About PCGen**](/menu/help/about-pcgen.html) option displays
    the current release version/date of PCGen, as well as listing the
    main contributors. There are far too many contributors to list them
    all as PCGen is very much a community effort. Info on where to get
    new releases of PCGen, how to find the PCGen community, and the LGPL
    license are also provided.
