This is the starting point for creating a new PC within PCGen. Using the
tabs that are listed the user will move throughout each one building the
PC piece by piece until the finished PC is ready to be saved and/or
exported. Following the tabs in order is the easiest way to make sure
all sections of the PC are fleshed out and complete.

Each tab is explained fully, and if you have any questions during use of
PCGen, you can always use the 'Help on Context' option in the Menu, Help
section. Using that option will bring up the exact page in the
walkthrough documentation (This documentation) without the screenshot,
only the text information, making it easier to match up what you see at
the moment.
