![Main Tab: Source Materials](../../images/tabs/sourcematerial.png)

This tab lists all of the sources available for character creation. The
list will contain an entry for each .pcc file that is present in the
PCGen data directories.

The table in the upper-left contains the list of "Available" sources.

By changing the "Available" pull-down mode, the user can control how
this list is displayed. The options are:

-   **Name Only** - Shows each .pcc file as a separate entry. Uses the
    Campaign tag.
-   **Company** - Groups the .pcc files by the company tag. The next
    level shows the individual .pcc files using the campaign tag.
-   **Company/Setting** - Groups the .pcc files by the company tag. The
    next level groups by the last element of the Type tag (i.e.
    the setting). The last level shows the individual .pcc files using
    the campaign tag.
-   **Comp/Fmt/Setting** - Groups the .pcc files by the company tag. The
    next level groups by the 2nd element of the Type tag (e.g. Module
    or Sourcebook). The next level groups by the last element of the
    Type tag (i.e. the setting). The last level shows the individual
    .pcc files using the campaign tag.

Click on the "+" sign to expand a group or the "-" to collapse them.

**To add a source:**

-   Highlight the Source in the left window and then click the
    "&gt;" (Add) button
-   Double Click the Source in the left window
-   Right Click on the Source in the left window and then choose
    **Select**
-   Press **&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;=&gt;**

All the items added are moved to the table on the upper-right. They are
not "loaded" automatically as this can take some time.

**To remove a source:**

-   Highlight the Source in the right window and then click the
    "&lt;" (Remove) button
-   Double Click the Source in the right window
-   Right Click on the Source in the right window and then choose
    **Remove**
-   Press **&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;-&gt;**

Once all the sources to be included in the character creation process
are in the upper-right table, click on the "Load" button in the
lower-right section.

When clicking on an item, info about it will be displayed in the panel
in the lower-left.

The lower-right section contains some buttons:

-   **Load** - load the sources you have added to the upper-right table
-   **Unload All** - unload all sources that were loaded
-   **Remove All** - remove all sources from the upper-right table (can
    also be done with a right click or **&lt;alt&gt;&lt;a&gt;** )
-   **Refresh** - this refreshes the list of sources in the upper-left
    table
-   **Website** - This will take the user to the website of the
    publisher automatically using the default browser (can also be done
    with a right click or **&lt;alt&gt;&lt;w&gt;** ).
-   **Customize** - Create new 'sources' which can combine parts of
    other sources
