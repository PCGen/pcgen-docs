Creating output sheets of any kind is even more difficult than list
editing, and we won't explain the mechanics of HOW to create a sheet
here, only the tokens used by the sheets to get the desired information
from PCGen. Creating output sheets requires a little knowledge of HTML
or XML and some javascript/VB Script knowledge doesn't hurt either!

Whether you have this knowledge or not, it is *strongly* recommended
that you take a look at how the current sheets are constructed and
'borrow' bits and pieces from them to build your own.

Special acknowledgment goes out to Richard O'Doherty-Gregg (oROGutang)
for his outstanding output sheets and the basis that all wanna-be sheet
makers aspire to. If mimicry is the purest form of flattery, then ROG
has been flattered more than most, as almost EVERY alternate sheet that
is used within PCGen is some way derived from his works!

Thanks Richard!

UPDATE!

Now we have Barak to thank. He has been busily (and happily... or else!)
updating the character sheets and tokens as well as writing up some
tutorials on how to use the tokens in the sheets (these are
forthcoming). But the new formatting and explanations used are really
top notch! So kudos to Barak for all his hard work.

The entire output token documentation has revised and formatted by Shane
Molnar (LetohNereg) with content help from Barak.
