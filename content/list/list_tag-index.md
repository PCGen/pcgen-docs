We have several resources to help those wishing to learn the arcane
craft of dataset creation. A good place to start is the [LST File
Classes](/list/lst-file-class/lst-file-class_index.html) , they give a good overview of
the basics of the dataset structure as well as detailed instructions on
coding races. Another good resource is the homebrew/my\_dataset
directory in the data folder. This is a framework for a PCGen dataset.
It is meant for beginners who want to take their first steps in entering
their own custom data into PCGen and have found that the built-in List
Editors are too limiting for what they intend to do. It contains some
commented out examples and a lot of advice and tips for putting your own
sets together. You can get up and running fast by renaming the elements
in this set to your suit your needs. Once you start delving deep into
LST code you're going to want to keep the [LST index
handy](/navlistindex.html) , most LST tags have been documented with
details on their use.

tags should still parse and work as they did before but will not in
future versions. Deprecated tag entries should indicate the tag that
replaces it.
