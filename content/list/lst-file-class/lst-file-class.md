The LST File Classes are designed to be a lecture series by accomplished
LST Chimps to help teach PCGen users how to do LST files for themselves
and for inclusion in PCGen distribution. These Classes were originally
posted at the [LSTFileClass Yahoo
Group](http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/) and questions
about the lessons can be fielded there. Other questions about LST file
editing can be fielded at the
[PCGenListFileHelp](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/)
Yahoo group.

The Professors of this series are Chris Chandler (Barak) and Professor
Andrew McDougall (Tir Gwaith). Both are veterans of the PCGen Data team
who frequently answer questions and provide sage advice on the arcane
art of LST editing on the various PCGen Mailing lists.

#### Conventions

Because HTML formatting cannot exactly replicate what you would see in a
LST file we are going to use certain conventions to convey these ideas.

 *&lt;TAB&gt; Delimiting* 
:   Tags in LST files are &lt;TAB&gt; deliminated, that is, the tags are
    separated by TABs. Because this is difficult to show, the tag
    examples in the LST examples will be separated by simple line breaks
    with no additional indention.

 *LST Code* 
:   Text meant to display LST code will be in the `code font` .

 Source Text 
:   Text taken from source will be indicated in **bold** .

 *Extended LST Lines* 
:   To improve readability, long LST tags will be formated with
    line-breaks with the subsequent lines indented.
