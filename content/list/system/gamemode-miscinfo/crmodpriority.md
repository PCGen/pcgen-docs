## Status

New 6.1.2

## Syntax

`CRMODPRIORITY:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Integer.



What it does
------------

If a character has multiple classes with different class types (such as,
for example, an aristocrat/fighter), this tag determines which CRMOD is
applied. For Pathfinder, if a character has a PC class, the CRMOD is
â€“1, but if he has ONLY NPC classes, the CRMOD is â€“2. Thus, the PC
CRMOD takes priority. The CRMODPROIRITY tag determines the priority in a
way that PCGen will choose the CRMOD with the lowest value of
CRMODPROIRITY.

Example
-------

`CRMODPRIORITY:1`

The CRMOD of this class type has the higher priority.

Where it is used
----------------

CLASSTYPE Line.
