## Status

New 5.9.5

## Syntax

`OPTION:x,y|x,y`

## Parameters

-   x: Number, JEP formula or VAR (Low range)
-   y: Number, JEP formula or VAR (High
    range, Optional)



What it does
------------

-   This tag is used on a line to determine randomly if the line will be
    granted to the character.
-   `OPTION` specifies a number range in which the line will be granted
    if it matches the number generated by the last preceding
    [SELECT](/list/data/startingkits/select.html) tag.

Example
-------

`SELECT:roll("1d100")`

`GEAR:Scimitar <tab> OPTION:1,50`

`GEAR:Falchion <tab> OPTION:51,100`

`GEAR:Full Plate <tab> OPTION:1,STR*5`

`GEAR:Shield<tab> OPTION:1,10|75,100`

`GEAR:The One Ring <tab> OPTION:100`

The SELECT tag sets a value between 1 and 100. If that value falls
within 1-50 the Scimitar is granted, if the value is between 51 and 100
the Falchion is granted, if the value is between 1 and the character's
Strength bonus times 5 the Full Plate is granted, if the value is
between 1 and 10 or 75 and 100 the Shield is granted. If the SELECT
value is exactly 100 The One Ring is granted and you had better start
packing.

Where it is used
----------------

GEAR, SKILL, CLASS, RACE, FEAT, etc. lines.
