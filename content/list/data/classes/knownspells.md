What it does
------------

-   Provides a pipe-delimited (|) and comma-delimited list of spells, by
    name, level, or type that are automatically added to the
    spell caster.
-   Parameters included as a comma-delimited set must all be met by the
    spell for it to be granted to the spell caster.
-   Spells are granted only if the spell caster meets all prerequisites.
    (e.g. class level and required spell-stat score.)
-   `.CLEARALL` will clear all spells awarded on Class or Class Level
    line 0.
-   NOTE: Level 0 Class Level Line acts as a Class Level Line, otherwise
    Class Level Lines are NOT allowed.
