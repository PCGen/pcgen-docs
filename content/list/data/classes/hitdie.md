What it does
------------

-   This tag can be used on a Class level line, a
    [SUBCLASSLEVEL](/list/data/classes/subclasslevel.html) line or a
    [SUBSTITUTIONLEVEL](/list/data/classes/substitutionlevel.html) line
    to specify a Hit Die size which will be applied only that level.
-   The scale used by the functions which raise or lower Hit Die in
    steps is defined by the
    [DIESIZES](/list/system/gamemode-miscinfo/diesizes.html)
    gameMode tag.
-   The scale used in most gameModes is:
    1,2,3,MIN=4,6,8,10,MAX=12,20,100,1000
-   When using the step up function (%upNumber) or step down
    function (%downNumber) the minimum and maximum steps are set by the
    MIN and MAX tags in the DIESIZES tag.
-   The step up function (%Hup) and step down functions (%Hdown) will
    ignore the MIN and MAX settings and use the full range of die sizes
    specified by the DIESIZES tag.
-   Regardless of the number it will never allow a hit die below 1.
-   HITDIE may also be used in [Race](/list/data/races/hitdie.html) and
    [Template](/list/data/templates/hitdie.html) files.

Example
-------

`HITDIE:12`

The character now has a Hit Dice of 12.

`HITDIE:%+2`

Adds 2 to the current Hit Dice size.

`HITDIE:%-4`

Subtracts 4 from the current Hit Dice size.

`HITDIE:%*3`

Multiplies the current Hit Dice size by 3.

`HITDIE:%/2`

Divides the current Hit Dice size by 2.

`HITDIE:%up2`

Steps up the Hit Dice size by two steps. If the class has a Hit Die of
d6 it will be stepped up to d10.

`HITDIE:%down1`

Steps down the Hit Dice size by one step. If the class has a Hit Die of
d6 it will be stepped down to d4.

Steps up the Hit Dice size by four steps. If the class has a Hit Die of
d6 it will be stepped up to d20.

of d6 it will be stepped down to d2.
