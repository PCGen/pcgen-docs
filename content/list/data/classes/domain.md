## Status

Updated 6.3.0

## Syntax

`DOMAIN:x|x`

-   x: Text



What it does
------------

-   This grants additional domains, as listed, directly to
    the character.
-   It is a pipe-delimited (|) list of domain names.
-   If a domain is added on top of the character's other normal domains,
    it will need to be paired with a `BONUS:DOMAIN|NUMBER|x` .
-   This tag can use trailing PRExxx tags to provide prerequisites for
    the domains included in the associated `DOMAIN` tag.
-   Multiple `DOMAIN` tags may be used in a class object, allowing
    access to some domains without prerequisites and some with.

`7 <tab> DOMAIN:Sun`

`11 <tab> DOMAIN:Sun|PREDEITY:Ra <tab> DOMAIN:Law`
