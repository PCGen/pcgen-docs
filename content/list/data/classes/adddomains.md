What it does
------------

-   This grants additional domain choices to the character, it is a
    decimal (.) delimited list of names.
-   It does not add them to the character's domains, but merely adds
    them to the list they can choose from.
-   If the character gets a choice for a bonus domain, it may need to be
    paired with a BONUS:DOMAIN|NUMBER|x tag.
-   If used in the Class Level block it should be put on the third line
    with the SPELLSTAT:and SPELLTYPE: entries.
-   It can contain PRExxx tags, in brackets (\[PRExxx\]), immediately
    after the domain name.
