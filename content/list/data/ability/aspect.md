## Status

New 5.15.2

## Syntax

`ASPECT:x|y|z|z`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Name of Aspect)
-   y: Text (Value of Aspect)
-   z: Number or Formula (Substitution value.
    Optional.)



What it does
------------

-   Identifies an "aspect" (see examples below) that an ability has and
    sets its value.
-   PRExxx tags can be used with the `ASPECT` tag.
-   This tag can be used multiple times within an ability but each time
    it must identify a new aspect unless the `ASPECT` tag includes a
    PRExxx tag appended to the end.
-   When using multiple `ASPECT` tags for the same "aspect" and PRExxx
    tags appended to the end of each, the final value for that aspect
    will be set by the physically last `ASPECT` tag in the ability line
    that passes the prerequisite.
-   The text in the (y) parameter can use %\# for substituting numerical
    values set by the (z) parameter, %1 is replaced by the first (z), %2
    is replaced by the second (z), etc..
-   The (y) parameter can also use other special variables as is done in
    the `DESC` tag:
    -   `%CHOICE` - Will replace the first associated choice in
        the object.
    -   `%LIST` - Will substitute all choices comma separated into
        that parameter.
    -   `%NAME` - The `OUTPUTNAME` or name of the object this `DESC` tag
        is in.
-   **.MOD Behavior:** When modifying an ability with the `.MOD` tag,
    given an existing `ASPECT` tag, the data included in a new `ASPECT`
    tag will selectively overwrite the existing tag data or include the
    separate tags. Since each aspect name can hold only one value per
    ability, modifying an existing `ASPECT` tag will overwrite only the
    value of the aspect by that name in the ability, and will add a
    separate `ASPECT` tag with a new name.
