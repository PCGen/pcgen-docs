## Status

Updated 5.11.11

## Syntax

`LEVEL:x:y:z`

## Parameters

-   x: Number (Level at which the benefit is granted)
-   y: ANY valid Template or Global Token which can
    accept trailing PRE tags can be used
-   z: Number or Text (Must be valid for the tag used)



What it does
------------

-   Grants the character an ability at the level specified.
-   This is the character's total character level.
-   The abilities of these tags have been enhanced so that they can call
    any global tag.\
-   The text may contain the following tags:\
    -   `ABILITY` - [Ability](/list/global/other/ability.html)
    -   `CR` - [Challenge Rating](/list/data/templates/cr.html)
    -   `DR` - [Damage Reduction](/list/global/other/dr.html)
    -   `FEAT` - [Feat](/list/data/templates.html#feat)
    -   `MOVE` - [Move](/list/global/other/move.html)
    -   `SAB` - [Special Ability](/list/global/other/sab.html)
    -   `SR` - [Spell Resistance](/list/global/other/sr.html)
    -   Any valid Template or Global Token which can accept trailing PRE
        tags can also be used
-   This may appear more than once in a template.
-   Feats added by this tag are considered automatic feats and do not
    count against a PC's feat pool.
-   **.MOD Behavior:** When modifying a template with the `.MOD` tag,
    given an existing `LEVEL` tag, the data included in a new `LEVEL`
    tag will be included as if it were a separate tag.
