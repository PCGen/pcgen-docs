        double weapon. Will return zero (0) if there is no second head.
    -   BASECOST - The unmodified cast value of the equipment.
    -   CRITMULT - The critical multiplier of the weapon.
    -   DMGDICE - The damage dice of the weapon.
    -   DMGDIE - The damage die of the weapon.
    -   HEADPLUSTOTAL - The total plus (+) for the head the equipmod is
        applied to.
    -   PLUSTOTAL - The total plus (+) for the primary head, for
        weapons, or main object, for non weapons.
    -   RANGE - The range of the weapon.
    -   SIZE - The size of the equipment.

Example
-------

`COST:300`

Adds 300 gold to the equipments cost.

`COST:BASECOST/2`

Adds half the base cost of the equipment to the cost.

`COST:500*WT`

Adds 500 gold per lb. to the equipments cost.

`COST:((BASECOST/50)*%CHARGES)-BASECOST`

Assuming this modifier adds 50 charges to the item, this formula makes
the value of a charge one fiftieth of the basecost making the cost of
the equipment proportional to the number of charges left in it.

`COST:(25*((%SPELLLEVEL)MAX(1/2))*%CASTERLEVEL)+%SPELLCOST+(5*%SPELLXPCOST)`

This is the cost formula from a scroll EQMOD.
