What it does
------------

-   Determines the minimum number of hands required to use the weapon.
    Defaults to a value of 1.
-   `#IFLARGERTHANWEAPON` is a flag that checks if the characters size
    is larger than the weapon.
    -   If true, the character is granted that prof.
    -   If not, the proficiency does not apply.
-   Used for Exotic 1-Hand weapons that are martial if wielded with
    both hands.
-   When modifying a weapon proficiency with the `.MOD` tag, given an
    existing `HANDS` tag, the data included in a new `HANDS` tag will
    overwrite the existing tag data.
