What it does
------------

-   Mandatory tag specifying the minimum version of PCGen that will
    support his dataset.
-   Normally this will be based on tags supported in the version
    of PCGen.
-   For the source to be installed by PCGen, the version of PCGen in use
    must be equal to or greater than this version.
-   e.g. a MINVER:5.14.1 value would mean that the source could not be
    installed by 5.14.0, but could be installed by 5.14.1 or 5.16.0

Example

`MINVER:5.14.1`

This dataset requires PCGen prodiction version 5.14.1 or later.
