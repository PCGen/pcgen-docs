<span id="visible"></span> \*\*\* New 5.7.7

What it does
------------

-   `YES` , `ALWAYS` - Shows the skill name in PCGen and on export to a
    character sheet.
-   `NO` - Hides the skill completely.
-   `DISPLAY` , `GUI` - Displays the skill name in PCGen but not on the
    character sheet.
-   `EXPORT` , `CSHEET` - Hides the skill name from PCGen but displays
    it on the character sheet.
-   `READONLY` - This will block the user from adding Ranks to the skill
    in the Skill Tab.
-   `READONLY` is not valid when `VISIBLE` is set to `EXPORT` or
    `CSHEET` .
-   **.MOD Behavior:** When modifying a skill with the `.MOD` tag, given
    an existing `VISIBLE` tag, the data included in a new `VISIBLE` tag
    will overwrite the existing tag data.
