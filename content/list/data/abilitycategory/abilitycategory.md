## Status

None

## Syntax

`ABILITYCATEGORY:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Name of the Ability Category).



\*\*\* Added 5.13.5

What it does
------------

-   The ABILITYCATEGORY tag begins a line which defines a category
    of abilities.
-   The ABILITYCATEGORY tag is optional as PCGen will take the first
    data element in each line as the name of the ability category
    being defined.
-   Visible ability categories will show as a sub-tab on the
    abilities tab.
-   If no extra parameters are provided on the line the category will
    default to being visible, editable, with no types, a display name
    and plural name matching the category name and an editable whole
    number only pool with a starting value of 0.

Example
-------

`ABILITYCATEGORY:Special Attack`

Defines a category named Special Attack.

`Special Attack <tab> PLURAL=Ambush`

Defines a category named Special Attack and sets the internationalized
name to "Ambush".
