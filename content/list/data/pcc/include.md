What it does
------------

-   The INCLUDE tag and its arguments are enclosed within a pair
    of parentheses.
-   The tag will add the pipe-delimited list of LST objects from the LST
    file the tag is associated with.
-   The tag will not prevent other .pcc files from loading the same
    LST file.
-   LST objects can include any of the following types: ABILITY, CLASS,
    COMPANIONMODS, DEITY, DOMAIN, EQUIPMENT, EQUIPMOD, FEAT, KIT,
    LANGUAGE, RACE, SKILL, SPELL, TEMPLATE, WEAPONPROF

<span class="new"> IMPORTANT NOTE: </span> Using INCLUDE for the same
file on multiple lines will cause only the first line with INCLUDE to be
processed.

Example
-------

`RACE:myrace.lst|(INCLUDE:Happy Elf|Dower Dwarf)`

This loads only the "Happy Elf" and the "Dower Dward" from `myrace.lst`
.

`ABILITY:myability.lst|(INCLUDE:CATEGORY=Class Ability,Monkey See,Monkey Do)`

This loads only the "Monkey See" and "Monkey Do" Class Abilities from
`myability.lst` .
