What it does
------------

-   This tag will suppress the "Unconstructed Object" error reports for
    the listed LST objects from appearing within the user interface.
-   This is useful during source loading when objects are referenced
    that will not be loaded with the given source.
-   The FORWARDREF only applies if the PCC is directly loaded. Since the
    FORWARDREF tag's purpose is to hide intentional omissions it always
    needs to be intentionally placed.

Example
-------

`FORWARDREF:CLASSSPELLLIST|Assassin,Black Guard`

"Unconstructed Object" errors for the "'Assassin" and "Black Guard"
spell lists will be suppressed during source loading.
