## Status

None

## Syntax

`PCC:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (File path)



What it does
------------

-   Tells PCGen to load additional pcc files along with the current
    pcc file.
-   If the campaign file to be loaded by this tag isn't located in the
    same folder as the current campaign file then file path must
    be included.
    -   The `@` symbol used at the beginning of the file path will set
        the **data** folder as the top folder in the path.
    -   The `&` symbol used at the beginning of the file path will set
        the **vendor** folder as the top folder in the path.
    -   The `$` symbol used at the beginning of the file path will set
        the **homebrew** folder as the top folder in the path.
-   It is recommended that this tag be placed before any tags that load
    LST files.
