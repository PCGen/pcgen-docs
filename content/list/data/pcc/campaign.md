## Status

None

## Syntax

`CAMPAIGN:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Name of source)



What it does
------------

-   This *MUST* be the first line in the file. The standard format used
    is Company Short Name (Foo) - Campaign Name - Name of material
-   The use of the ampersand (&) sign will cause significant problems
    with PCGen, so recommended usage is to replace with the word "and"
    or the letter "n" to avoid this.

NOTE: The comma (,) should not be used in campaign names.
