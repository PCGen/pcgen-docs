------------

-   The replacement/substitution symbol (%) may be used at the end of
    the skill name.
-   Monster class skills are only class skills for monster classes such
    as Giant, Outsider, Undead etc.
-   If a monster takes levels in a base class only those skills defined
    as class skills in that class count as class skills for that level,
    the monster class skills will not apply.
-   **.MOD Behavior:** When modifying a race with the `.MOD` tag, given
    an existing `MONCSKILL` tag, the data included in a new `MONCSKILL`
    tag will be appended to the existing tag data.
