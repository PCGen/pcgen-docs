## Status

Updated 5.15.8

## Syntax

`FAVCLASS:x|x.y`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Base class name)
-   x: ANY
-   y: Text (Base class or sub-class name)



What it does
------------

-   Determines the Race's favored class.
-   Classes with sub-classes must use the (x.y) syntax and must include
    the base-class name or the sub-class name.
-   More than one class may be included as a pipe-delimited (|) list
    with all listed classes identified as "Favored".
-   Special type 'ANY' will grant the character's highest level class
    as Favored.
-   When 'ANY' is used no other class is allowed.
-   **.MOD Behavior:** When modifying a race with the `.MOD` tag, given
    an existing `FAVCLASS` tag, the data included in a new `FAVCLASS`
    tag will overwrite the existing tag data.

Example
-------
