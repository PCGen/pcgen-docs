What it does
------------

-   This is a period (.) delimited list of equipment modifiers applied
    to the secondary head of a double weapon.
-   With the exception that it is applied to the secondary head is
    functions in the same way as the
    [EQMOD](/list/data/equipment/eqmod.html) tag.
-   This is utilized by other EQMODs which contain the ASSIGNTOALL tag.
    For example the Darkwood EQMOD has ASSIGNTOALL:YES and it replaces
    wood, for this to work correctly a double weapon needs to have both
    the EQMOD:WOOD and ALTEQMOD:WOOD tags present. When they are present
    the Darkwood EQMOD is applied to and replaces the WOOD EQMOD on
    both heads.

Example
-------

`ALTEQMOD:WOOD`

2nd head has the WOOD EQMOD applied to it.
