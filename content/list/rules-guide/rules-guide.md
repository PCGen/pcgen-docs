The Game Rules Implementation Guide provides a series of rules
implementation explanations, organized in two sections: The [PCGen
Distributed Rules](/list/rules-guide/index.html#pcgendist) and the
[Rules for Homebrews](/list/rules-guide/index.html#homebrew) . The
exaples provided are not the only way to implement the subject rules.
They are given here simply as examples of how different rules can be
implemented. For more general information on writing standard LST files
please visit the [LST File Class](/list/lst-file-class/lst-file-class_index.html) page.

[Instructions](/list/rules-guide/reading-instructions.html) on how to
read these pages can be found below.

the officially distributed datasets from PCGen.

Rules for Homebrews
-------------------

This section includes rules implementation solutions aimed at homebrew
datasets. As game rules can have many different implementations within
PCGen, you will find implementations included below that address the
same game rule. In these cases, each solution is presented on its own
page for clarity.

> [Buying Abilities with Skill Ranks](/list/rules-guide/grig-abilities-by-skill_ranks.html)
