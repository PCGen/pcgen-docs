## Status

None

## Syntax

`PREGENDER:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Gender to require).



What it does
------------

Sets gender requirement.  The character's gender must start with the
text specified. The test is case sensitive so "male" is not the same as
"Male".  The PCGen GUI allows the following genders by default: Male,
Female, Neuter, None, and Other.

Example
-------

`PREGENDER:M`

Character's gender must start with "M".
