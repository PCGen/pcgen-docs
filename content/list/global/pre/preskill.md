## Parameters

-   x: Number (Number of skills)
-   y: Text (Skill name)
-   y: TYPE.Text (Skill type)

What it does
------------

-   Sets skill requirements.
-   If you require multiples of a particular type of skill, you need to
    include a `TYPE.Text` sub-tag for each instance in the comma
    delimited list.
-   Skills types with multiple versions like "Craft (Pottery)" or
    "Knowledge (Local)" there must be a space between the name and the
    parentheses because the text must match the entry exactly.
