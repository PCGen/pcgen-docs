## Syntax

`PREPCLEVEL:x,y`

## Parameters

-   x: MIN=Number or formula (Minimum total level).
-   y: MAX=Number or formula (Maximum total level).



What it does
------------

-   Provides the minimum and/or maximum total character class levels the
    character must have to qualify.
-   PREPCLEVEL does not count Monster (Racial) class levels.
-   Class types PC, NPC and Prestige all count as character classes.

racial hitdice (monster levels) but only 1 or no character class levels
will still qualify.
