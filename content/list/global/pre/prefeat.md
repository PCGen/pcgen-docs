### PREFEAT

**Status:**

-   6.05.04 (July 2015): JIRA
    [NEWTAG-477](http://jira.pcgen.org/browse/NEWTAG-477) / Github [PR
    \#380](https://github.com/PCGen/pcgen/pull/380)
-   -   `PREFEAT` is deprecated. Use
        [`PREABILITY`](/list/global/pre/preability.html) instead.
    -   All `FEAT` tags have been **deprecated** and replaced by the
        `ABILITY` system, which is more general. The `ABILITY` system
        can model feats, racial features, class features, traits, flaws,
        temporary bonuses, and so on, all using a common format.

What it does
------------

-   Sets character feat requirements.
-   Feats with multiple instances where the instance is expressed within
    parentheses, e.g. Skill Focus or Spell Focus, there is no space
    between the name of the feat and the parentheses.
-   Use of the `(TYPE=<text>)` syntax with feats with multiple
    instances, e.g. `Weapon Focus(TYPE=Bow)` , though allowed, is only
    supported for feats with internal choosers for `DOMAIN` , `SKILL` ,
    `SPELL` , and `WEAPONPROF` types.
