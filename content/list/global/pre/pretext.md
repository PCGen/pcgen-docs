## Status

None

## Syntax

`PRETEXT:x`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Explanation of requirement)



What it does
------------

This is used when there are special requirements which are not covered
by another PRExxx tag.

Mainly used for feats the text is displayed in the same field as the
other pre-requisites.

This tag in itself does not disqualify anything but alerts the player to
the additional pre-requisites.

Example
-------

`PRETEXT:Character must make a sacrifice of bananas to the Monkey God.`

Explains what additional requirements are needed for the character to
qualify.
