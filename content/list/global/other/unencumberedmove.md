## Syntax

`UNENCUMBEREDMOVE:x`

## Parameters

What it does
------------

This is a global tag that allows the character to ignore encumbrance
penalties to movement.

This tag is backwards inclusive, so if you have
UNENCUMBEREDMOVE:MediumLoad it means you also have
UNENCUMBEREDMOVE:LightLoad.

This can be | (pipe) delimited in order to negate both the encumbrance
and armor penalties.

Example
-------

`UNENCUMBEREDMOVE:HeavyLoad|HeavyArmor`

This is used in the Race entry for Dwarves, Dwarves ignore encumbrance
penalties to movement for heavy armor and heavy loads.
