## Syntax

`ABILITY:x|y|z|z`

## Parameters

-   x: Text (Ability category)
-   y: Text (Ability nature)
-   z: Text (Ability name or key)
-   z: TYPE=Text (Ability type)
-   z: .CLEAR
-   z: .CLEAR.Text (Ability name or key)



What it does
------------

-   Adds an ability, of the given category and nature, to a character.
-   The listed Ability Category must have been defined in the
    appropriate *gamemode/miscinfo.lst* or *abilitycategory.lst* file.
-   Valid Ability Natures are NORMAL, AUTOMATIC, or VIRTUAL.
-   When adding an ability to a category, that category's pool will be
    charged only if the "Nature" is NORMAL.
-   When including a feat with an internal chooser, subchoices can be
    handled one of two ways.
-   -   Subchoices must be specified within the tag. (e.g. Weapon Focus
        (Longsword)).\
         or
    -   Used in conjunction with the `CHOOSE` tag, `%LIST` can be used
        with this tag to provide the required choice.
-   The standard list for the ability category will be used to find a
    matching ability.
-   ABILITY tags can be qualified with [PRExxx](/list/global/pre.html)
    tags unless they use the `%LIST` parameter. ABILITY tags qualified
    with PRExxx tags will not be added unless the character meets
    the prerequisites.
-   For specific infomation on the `.CLEAR` tag, read the
    [.CLEAR](/list/global/other/clear.html) docs.
-   This tag is a replacement for the following tags: FEAT, VFEAT,
    and FEATAUTO.

**Note:** This tag **WILL NOT** activate a CHOOSER inside of a feat. You
must use [ADD:FEAT](/list/global/add/feat.html) to activate a chooser
inside of a feat being granted.
