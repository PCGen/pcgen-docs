## Syntax

`DEFINESTAT:x|y|z`

## Parameters

-   x: LOCK
-   x: UNLOCK
-   x: NONSTAT
-   x: STAT
-   x: MINVALUE
-   x: MAXVALUE
-   y: Text (Stat defined in loaded gameMode)

What it does
------------

-   This tag will lock or unlock the value of an ability score.
    -   Using `LOCK` will lock the designated ability score (y) to the
        value (z) regardless of any other bonuses to that ability score
        except for those applied by the
        [BONUS:LOCKEDSTAT](/list/global/bonus/lockedstat.html) tag.
    -   Using `UNLOCK` will unlock the designated ability score (y) that
        has previously been locked.
    -   The `UNLOCK` sub-tag will not affect an ability score that has
        been designated as a "nonstat". (see `NONSTAT` below).
-   This tag will also change an ability score from a stat to a nonstat.
    -   Ability scores are by default designated as "stats" when
        initialized during character creation.
    -   Using `NONSTAT` will change an ability score to a non-stat,
        causing it to be shown as an asterisk (\*) on output sheets and
        prohibiting any bonuses from being applied.
    -   Using `STAT` will change an ability score that has been
        previously designated as a nonstat back to a stat without
        affecting its locked/unlocked state.
-   Using `MINVALUE` defines the minimum value (z) for the designated
    ability score (y).
-   Using `MAXVALUE` defines the maximum value (z) for the designated
    ability score (y).
