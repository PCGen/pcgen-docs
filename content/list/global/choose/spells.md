What it does
------------

-   Presents a list of spells matching the criteria defined by the
    included sub-tags.
-   The `PROHIBITED` sub-tag will restrict the presented spell list to
    prohibited ("YES") spells or non-prohibited ("NO") spells. If it is
    not included, both are presented.
-   The `SPELLBOOK` sub-tag is used to reference the specific spell
    book, such as "Innate", in which the spells is located.
-   The spell type used in the `SPELLTYPE` sub-tag above MUST be used in
    a `SPELLTYPE` tag within a loaded class.
-   The `KNOWN` sub-tag will restrict the presented spell list to
    known ("YES") spells or unknown ("NO") spells. If it is not
    included, both are presented.
-   The `LEVELMIN` sub-tag references all spells of the specified level
    and higher within the context of the "y" variable preceding
    the brackets.
-   The `LEVELMAX` sub-tag references all spells of the specified level
    and lower within the context of the "y" variable preceding
    the brackets.
-   The "z" variable **MUST** be contained within a set of
    square-brackets (\[ \]) and paired with a single "y" variable. Only
    one set of square brackets per "y" variable is allowed.
-   Independent "z" parameters require the use of multiple sets of
    square brackets (\[ \]), one for each "z" parameter paired with is
    own "y" parameter. (e.g. y\[z\]|y\[z\])
-   Dependent "z" parameters can use a common set of square-brackets
    (\[ \]) paired with the associated "y" parameter. (e.g. y\[z;z\])
-   **Note:** y\[z;z\]|y\[z\] is legal, y\[z\]\[z\] is not.
-   The [SELECT](/list/global/other/select.html) tag is used in
    conjunction with this `CHOOSE` tag to define the number of
    "selections" that can be made.
