What it Does
------------

-   Adds to indicated combat bonus, i.e.:
    -   Using the `AC` syntax adds to the armor class.
    -   Using the `ATTACKS` syntax adds to the number of attacks the
        primary hand gets.
    -   Using the `BASEAB` syntax increases the base attack bonus and
        may increase the number of attacks the primary hand gets.
    -   Using the `DAMAGE` syntax increases the damage bonus but the
        weapon and damage types specified must be valid equipment types
        assigned to a weapon in the current data set or must have been
        defined by the `WEAPONTYPE` tag in the current gamemode.
        Examples of standard Weapon and Weapon Damage types can be found
        on the [Global Type](/list/global/type.html#equipment) page.
    -   Using the `DAMAGEMULT` syntax increases the damage multiplier
        for the designated hand(s) wielding the weapon. Bonuses are
        additive between each `BONUS` . Two
        `BONUS:COMBAT|DAMAGEMULT:0|1.5` tags will do a total of x3
        damage, not 2.25.
    -   Using the `DAMAGESIZE` syntax increases, or decreases, the
        damage die size along the same scale as is used for weapon size,
        i.e.:
        -   Base Damage Dice:1d2
