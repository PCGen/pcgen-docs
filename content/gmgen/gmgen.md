PCGen now includes the game master aid GMGen. GMGen has been developed
as a well-rounded tool for the RPG gaming community to help you, the
Game Master, to effectively manage and facilitate the game from a
computer. Until now, multiple third party solutions existed, but none
were compatible with the PCGen system. GMGen is designed using a Plug-in
software architecture so individual Plug-ins can be removed from GMGen
without effecting the performance of other Plug-ins. To activate GMGen
click the GMGen icon on the toolbar or choose GMGen from the Tools menu.
Until you activate GMGen the program is not loaded into memory and will
not effect PCGen.

The GMGen application allows you to:

-   Load PCGen character files and view characters' statistics via live
    character sheets
-   Set encounter levels and number of creatures to generate encounters
-   Track combat
-   Allocate Experience
-   Generate Random Names
-   Calculate various aspects of overland travel
-   Generate random numbers with the DiceBag plugin
-   Create and maintain your campaign notes using text, hyperlinks and
    other media
-   Network multiple copies of PCGen together

Some of the tabs in GMGen will allow you to Save and Open files specific
to the active tab. For example the Dice Bag plugin saves custom dice
bags with the extension .dbg and the Initiative plugin will save the
complete state of the Initiative tab to a file with the .gmi extension.
